    </div>

    <h2 class="section-title">Creating a Positive Mindset</h2>
    <p>Maintaining a positive mindset helps you focus on the joys of your relationship rather than its challenges. Take time to appreciate small moments, be kind to yourself, and focus on growth instead of perfection. These shifts in perspective can improve both your personal happiness and the quality of your intimate life.</p>
