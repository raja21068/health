    <h1>Communication in Relationships</h1>
    <p>Effective communication is the foundation of any strong relationship. It builds trust, understanding, and connection. Here are some key areas to focus on and tips to help improve communication in intimate relationships.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Why Communication Matters</h2>
    <p>In any relationship, communication helps both partners express their needs, set boundaries, and build mutual respect. Open conversations can prevent misunderstandings, foster intimacy, and create a space where both partners feel safe to share their thoughts and feelings.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Key Areas of Communication</h2>

    <!-- Tip 1: Setting Boundaries -->
    <div class="tip-card">
        <div class="tip-title">Setting Boundaries</div>
        <p>Boundaries are essential for a healthy relationship. They help each partner understand what is comfortable and acceptable, creating a sense of respect. Discuss your limits openly, and listen to your partner’s boundaries as well.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Tip 2: Expressing Needs and Desires -->
    <div class="tip-card">
        <div class="tip-title">Expressing Needs and Desires</div>
        <p>Be open and honest about your needs and desires in the relationship. Whether it's about emotional support, time together, or physical intimacy, sharing your needs clearly can lead to greater satisfaction for both partners.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Tip 3: Active Listening -->
    <div class="tip-card">
        <div class="tip-title">Active Listening</div>
        <p>Listening actively means giving your full attention to your partner’s words without interrupting. Show understanding by nodding, paraphrasing, or asking follow-up questions. This helps the other person feel heard and valued.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Tip 4: Handling Conflict Respectfully -->
    <div class="tip-card">
        <div class="tip-title">Handling Conflict Respectfully</div>
        <p>Disagreements are normal, but handling them with respect is key. Avoid blaming language and focus on how you feel. Use "I" statements, such as "I feel upset when…" to express yourself without making the other person defensive.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Tip 5: Being Honest and Vulnerable -->
    <div class="tip-card">
        <div class="tip-title">Being Honest and Vulnerable</div>
        <p>Honesty and vulnerability build trust. Share your feelings openly, even if they are difficult. This can strengthen your bond, as it shows your partner you trust them with your emotions.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="note"><em>*Remember, communication takes practice. Approach conversations with patience, empathy, and a willingness to grow together.</em></p>
