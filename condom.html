    <h1>The Importance of Using Condoms for Safer Sex</h1>

    <p>Condoms are one of the most effective methods for reducing the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unintended pregnancy. They provide a barrier that helps protect both partners, making them an essential tool in promoting sexual health.</p>

    <!-- Section 1: Why Use Condoms? -->
    <div class="card">
        <div class="card-title">Why Use Condoms?</div>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Prevention of STIs:</strong> Condoms reduce the risk of STIs, including HIV, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and HPV, by preventing bodily fluids from exchanging during sex.</li>
            <li><strong>Birth Control:</strong> Condoms are effective at preventing pregnancy when used correctly every time.</li>
            <li><strong>Accessible and Affordable:</strong> Condoms are widely available, affordable, and do not require a prescription, making them a practical choice for many people.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 2: How Condoms Work -->
    <div class="section-title">How Condoms Work</div>
    <p>Condoms act as a physical barrier that blocks semen, vaginal fluids, and other bodily fluids from mixing. Made from materials like latex, polyurethane, or polyisoprene, they are designed to fit snugly over the penis or inside the vagina, depending on the type (male or female condom), to prevent direct contact and reduce risk.</p>

    <!-- Section 3: Tips for Using Condoms Correctly -->
    <div class="section-title">Tips for Using Condoms Correctly</div>
    <ul>
        <li>Check the expiration date and package for any signs of damage before use.</li>
        <li>Open the package carefully to avoid tearing the condom. Don’t use teeth or sharp objects.</li>
        <li>Pinch the tip of the condom to remove any air, then roll it down fully on an erect penis.</li>
        <li>After ejaculation, hold the condom at the base while pulling out to prevent it from slipping off.</li>
        <li>Dispose of the condom in the trash – do not flush it down the toilet.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Section 4: Choosing the Right Condom -->
    <div class="card">
        <div class="card-title">Choosing the Right Condom</div>
        <p>There are different types of condoms, including latex, non-latex (for those with allergies), lubricated, and textured. Finding the type that feels comfortable and fits well can enhance protection and pleasure. Experimenting with different styles can help you find the best option.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 5: Additional Benefits of Using Condoms -->
    <div class="card">
        <div class="card-title">Additional Benefits of Using Condoms</div>
        <p>Besides protection, condoms can enhance intimacy by showing care for a partner’s health. Condoms can also reduce anxiety about STIs or unintended pregnancy, allowing both partners to feel more relaxed and connected during intimacy.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="note"><em>*Remember: Condoms are highly effective when used correctly every time. They should be used consistently for the best protection. If you have questions about condoms or other contraception methods, consult a healthcare provider.</em></p>
